# Malliavin_CFA
This repository contains working code for pricing European put options with piecewise-constant parameters in the Verhulst and SABR-mu models using the Malliavin calculus closed-form approximation formula detailed in Section 6 and Appendix F of the article 'Explicit approximations of option prices via Malliavin calculus in a general stochastic volatility framework'.

### Quickstart for readers of article

Simply run Verhulst_compare_pw.py, which computes and compares the price and implied volatility of a European put option in the Verhulst model with piecewise-constant parameter inputs, where the price is obtained via the Malliavin calculus closed-form approximation method and mixing solution Monte-Carlo method.

### Main files 

The following .py files are required in order to compute the closed-form approximation formula.

- **Verhulst_CFA_Malliavin.py:**
